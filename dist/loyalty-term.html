This suspension or termination shall be without prejudice to the Programme Administrator’s right to take action with respect to a Member.
											</p>
											<h2>
												7. EARNING HIGH REWARDS POINTS
											</h2>
											<p>
												When a Member completes an eligible stay at one of the hotels participating in the Programme and this stay includes at least one paid night that the Member actually spends at the hotel, the Member's account is credited with Points.
											</p>
											<p>
												Only a whole number of Points may be credited. If application of the Points earned scale leads to Points with a decimal fraction, the number of Points credited will be the next lowest whole number.
											</p>
											<p>
												For crediting Points, the amount paid in local currency outside the Indonesia zone will be converted to Indonesia Rupiah before applying the earned Points scales. The exchange rate applied by the hotel at Check-out is taken from the "Multidevises" database (a Reuters Bank database of monetary and financial information).
											</p>
											<p>
												Points and Eligible Nights may not be transferred to another Member. They are strictly personal and non-transferable.
											</p>
											<p>
												Points do not constitute a means of payment and have no monetary value. No money shall be provided for lost or unused Points.
											</p>
											<h3>
												7.1. Reservation channels eligible for Points
											</h3>
											<p>
												Only stays booked at eligible rates via Hotel Indonesia Group distribution channels (Hotel Indonesia Group internet sites, and Hotel Indonesia Group reservation centre, hotelsconnected automatically to the Hotel Indonesia reservation centre, entitle the Member to earn Points.
											</p>
											<p>
												Eligible stays therefore specifically do not include stays booked via a reseller, tour operator or third-party online travel agent (such as Expedia.com, Booking.com, etc.). These stays do not enable the Member to earn Points or to collect Eligible Nights to obtain a Status.
											</p>
											<h3>
												7.2. Eligible booking rates
											</h3>
											<p>
												Only stays booked at an eligible rate enable the Member to benefit from the Programme.
											</p>
											<p>
												Eligible booking rates include all public, corporate and promotional rates, except for the following: - Room rates for group bookings when the rooms are invoiced to and paid for globally by the organiser (excluding the HIGH Pro promotional offer); - Rates proposed to employees of partner companies (travel, tourism, etc.), also known as “Partner/Industry Rates”; - Room rates for crew members (airline, shipping or other); - Rates for Hotel Indonesia Group employees, employees of Hotel Indonesia Group partner companies and service providers; - Tour operator rates.
											</p>
											<h3>
												7.3. Eligible expenses
											</h3>
											<p>
												Only the following expenses are eligible to earn Points and only if they are paid for by a Member who is actually staying at the hotel:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Expenses for Member accommodation and, if applicable, for one other room at the same hotel on the same date (for a maximum of three invoiced rooms), provided that (i) the Member is staying in one of these rooms and that (ii) the others room is not occupied by another Member; note that if the Member books two rooms, Points are earned for these two rooms, but the number of Eligible Nights is based only on the Member's room;</li>
												<li>Services in addition to hotel accommodations, namely: minibar, room service, Member meals at the hotel restaurant, and drinks at the hotel bar;</li>
												<li>Points are calculated on the basis of the total invoice for eligible expenses, excluding tax & services. The invoice must be settled in full. In other words, the payment must have been accepted and confirmed by the hotel. In the event of full or partial default in the payment of an invoice, and notably if the Member stops the payment of a cheque, issues a cheque that bounces or disputes a bank card payment, he/she will not receive any Points for the transaction in question and will not accumulate any Eligible Nights.</li>
												<li>The following expenditures do not qualify for earning Points: additional expenditures incurred as part of a non-eligible stay (even if settled at the hotel);</li>
												<li>taxes (notably VAT), tips, taxis, transfers to/from the hotel, service charges and other applicable charges;</li>
												<li>advances;</li>
												<li>expenses incurred as part of organising a company seminar, banquet or any other event – including private events – settled globally by the Member (except for the HIGH Pro promotional offer);</li>
												<li>all charges and expenses which are not specifically listed as eligible expenditures.</li>
											</ul>
											<h3>
												7.4. Rewards Points Scale
											</h3>
											<p>
												The Programme offers four Status levels that are attributed according to the number of Eligible Nights or Status Points earned: Blue, Silver, Gold and Platinum.
											</p>
											<p>
												Each Status has its own scale for Rewards Points earned, as shown in the table below
											</p>
											<table>
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th>STATUS</th>
														<th>NUMBER OF SPENDING AMOUNT TO EARN 1 high REWARDS POINT</th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<th>BLUE</th>
														<td>Rp 3,750</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<th>SILVER</th>
														<td>Rp 3,500</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<th>GOLD</th>
														<td>Rp 2,750</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<th>PLATINUM</th>
														<td>Rp 2,500</td>
													</tr>
												</tbody>
											</table>
											<p>
												If a Member's Status changes between booking and Check-out, the rules used for attributing Rewards Points will be those of the Status at Check-in. For a stay of several consecutive nights, Members are entitled to only one Rewards Points credit when the total invoice is paid.
											</p>
											<h3>
												7.6. Special offers and promotional operations
											</h3>
											<p>
												Members may also earn Rewards Points in the context of special offers or promotional operations organised by the Programme. In this context, earning Rewards Points depends on meeting specific conditions that apply to each offer or operation, and that are communicated to Members.
											</p>
											<h3>
												7.7. Validity of Rewards Points
											</h3>
											<p>
												Rewards Points are creditable within 365 days in a year. Rewards Points are earned following a stay at a Participating Hotel, that date is considered to be the date of Check-out. When Rewards points are earned following an eligible HIGH Pro event, that date is considered to be the date on which the Rewards Points are credited to the Member's account.
											</p>
											<p>
												Every 31st December of the calendar year, all the points collected by the member will be reset, and count to zero balance without prior notice, without being able to restore or transfered.
											</p>
											<p>
												Status Points are valid until 31st December of the calendar year in which they were earned. Status Points are credited as from the date of Check-out.
											</p>

											<h2>
												8. STATUS
											</h2>
											<p>
												Members may at any time access a higher Status if they reach the required number of Status Points, as shown in the table below.
											</p>
											<table>
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th>STATUS</th>
														<th>NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE NIGHTS</th>
														<th>NUMBER OF ACCUMULATED STATUS POINTS</th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<th>SILVER</th>
														<td>15</td>
														<td>3.000</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<th>GOLD</th>
														<td>30</td>
														<td>6.750</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<th>PLATINUM</th>
														<td>60</td>
														<td>10.841</td>
													</tr>
												</tbody>
											</table>
											<p>
												Once every 365 days At the start of each new year, an assessment is made of Eligible Nights completed and Status Points earned by a Member during the previous calendar year:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>If, during the previous calendar year, the Member reached one of the thresholds allowing them to maintain their current Status or access a higher Status, they retain that Status for 365 days; in 365 days after the member access a higher status, If, the Member did not reach one of the thresholds and did not make an eligible night allowing them to maintain their current Status, they will be awarded the Status directly below the one previously held, as indicated on the above scale.</li>
												<li>In 365 days after the member access a higher status, the Member did not reach one of the thresholds and did not make an eligible night allowing them to maintain their current Status, they may mantain their status.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												The use of Rewards Points has no effect on keeping or changing a Status.
											</p>
											<h2>
												9. BENEFITS AND SERVICES OFFERED TO MEMBERS
											</h2>
											<h3>
												9.1 Programme Benefits and services applicable to all Members
											</h3>
											<p>
												In addition to receiving Points, Members with a status of Silver or higher enjoy other status-related benefits.
											</p>
											<p>
												Only the cardholder Member is entitled to the benefits associated with the membership card.
											</p>
											<p>
												These benefits are offered on the condition that the Member’s stay is eligible to earn Points, with the exception of Day Use bookings as defined herein.
											</p>
											<p>
												These benefits are described more fully in the “HIGH Rewards” section of the www.hotelindonesiagroup.co.id website.
											</p>
											<p>
												In particular, the guarantee of an available room before arrival is subject to the following specific conditions:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The guarantee covers room availability only and not a particular type of room.</li>
												<li>Reservation must be made before noon, 12:00PM (local time at the hotel) and at least three days (for Gold cardholders) or two days (for Platinum cardholders) prior to the date of arrival.</li>
												<li>The Member must request this guarantee at the time of booking.</li>
												<li>In hotels identified as belonging to the “resorts” category, the guarantee of availability is applicable only to stays of a minimum of seven nights. - This guarantee applies only to stays booked via Hotel Indonesia Group distribution channels, paid for at the standard or full rate (excluding promotions or discounts) and for one room only (the Member’s room). For bookings that include several rooms, this guarantee therefore does not apply to the additional rooms. - If the hotel is unable to guarantee room availability, it commits to accommodating the Member at another nearby Hotel Indonesia Group hotel or at a hotel in an equivalent category. If the Member is accommodated at a hotel that is not part of the Hotel Indonesia group, the hotel will refund any difference in the cost of the first night and any related transportation fees, upon presentation by the Member of the corresponding invoices. All accommodation expenses for this night (price paid by the Member, as well as the additional price reimbursed by the hotel) enable Points credit and collecting Eligible Nights. - The availability guarantee does not apply on certain dates. The official calendar of dates on which the availability guarantee does not apply is regularly updated and displayed for Members on the www.hotelindonesiagroup.co.id website. It is up to Members to take note of these dates before booking a stay for which they require an availability guarantee ( see list of blackout dates ).</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>
												9. REDEEMING REWARDS POINTS
											</h2>
											<p>
												Members can use their Rewards Points to obtain Rewards, which notably include: - the opportunity to pay less for an eligible stay in a participating hotel; - benefits from certain Partners, notably by converting Rewards Points into points for other Partner loyalty programmes (such as air miles);
											</p>
											<p>
												The use of Rewards Points to obtain a reduction on the amount of the invoice issued for an eligible stay at a participating hotel is subject to compliance with the following rules:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Rewards Points can only be used for eligible stays to gain HIGH Rewards points pursuant to article 7 of the general conditions of the Programme, which means for an eligible stay comprising accommodation and on-site expenses, or for an eligible stay comprising accommodation only, with the exception of Day use bookings;</li>
												<li>Rewards Points can only be used for reservations at participating hotels made through the www.hotelindonesiagroup.co.id website.</li>
												<li>Rewards Points can only be used in multiples of 2,500 Rewards Points: 2,500 Rewards Points entitle the Member to a reduction of Rp 250,000 on the price (including tax) of accommodation or on-site expenses. A Member cannot use a number of Rewards Points that would entitle them to a reduction of an amount greater than the total price of the accommodation or on-site expenses concerned. The Member must use the means of payment normally accepted online or at the hotel to pay the remaining price not covered by the reduction obtained;</li>
												<li>Reservations at a rate which is subject to prepayment (where cancellations and changes are not permitted) can be made using only Rewards Points and must include a part paid by credit or debit card.</li>
												<li>Rewards Points will not be recredited in the event of a Member’s request to change or cancel a reservation at any condition or if a member failed to arrive at the hotel</li>
												<li>all reservations and expenses deemed eligible as per these Terms and Conditions, but paid for in full with Rewards Points, are not eligible to earn Rewards Points nor entitle the Member to accumulate Eligible Nights, provided that the conditions for so doing, as defined in the Programme's General Conditions of Use, are met.</li>

											<h2>
												10. MEMBER ACCOUNT ISSUES
											</h2>
											<p>
												Claims within the participating hotel network
											</p>
											<p>
												If the Member notes that his/her Points were not credited as expected after a minimum of fourteen working days following the Member’s stay at a participating hotel, the Member may submit a claim for Points adjustment within six months following the stay in question (based on the Check-out date). To do this, the Member must fill out the claim form available in the “Report missing Points after stay” section under the “Loyalty” tab in the Member’s online account at www.hotelindonesiagroup.co.id.
											</p>
											<p>
												For the claim to be processed, the Member must attach a copy of the paid invoice from the relevant hotel. This invoice must not include handwritten modifications. Only the document printed by the hotel is acceptable and must be established in the name of the Member making a claim.
											</p>
											<p>
												Once a claim is proven to be justified, the correct number of Rewards Points will be credited to the Member’s account, along with the appropriate number of Status Points for the status assesment periods during which the stay took place. If being awarded the correct number of Status Points from the outset had enabled the Member to access a different Status level in accordance with the rules detailed in article 8 above, the Member will be awarded the Status level in question for the remainder of the current calendar year. The Rewards Points credited to the Member’s account prior to this rectification will be recalculated accordingly.
											</p>
											<p>
												If the Member is incorrectly refused a Points credit or benefit relating to his/her membership Status level, the Programme Administrator’s responsibility is limited to correctly recording Points on the Member's account.
											</p>

											<h2>

											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>In accordance with Article 4.1, Members are reminded that by becoming a Member of the Programme, they agree to receive electronic communications associated with the operation and services offered by the Programme (information messages, Points statements, etc.).

												<li>The Member must notify the Programme of any change of email or postal address, name, or any other relevant information, by providing the relevant proof to the customer care team.
													14. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
													Personal information regarding the Member collected at the time of subscription or during his/her membership in the Programme is processed by Hotel Indonesia Group, as data controller (with a registered office at Grha Inna, jl. Prof. Dr. Soepomo no. 8 Jakarta Selatan), for the purposes corresponding to the execution of the programme terms and conditions and, based on legitimate interest, for marketing activities (including targeted marketing campaigns).</li>
												<li>The data may also be disclosed to the programme contracting partners (hotels, airlines and other partners) in order for the member to take full advantage of these partners’ offers. The data may be transferred to countries which might not ensure an adequate level of protection. Therefore, appropriate and suitable safeguards are provided and you can request to obtain a copy. Data concerning Members may indeed be transmitted to recipients located in countries outside of the Indonesia. These include:</li>
												<li>Partner loyalty programmes and airlines that Members choose for Rewards Points or air miles transfer purposes and claim management. The list of Partners and companies is available in the HIGH Rewards section on www.hotelindonesiagroup.co.id. Members must expressly agree to each transfer of data, which is required for processing Rewards Points or transferring miles; - Entities and hotels within the Hotel Indonesia Group, since transfer is required for the execution of the contract between the Member and the data processor; - External service providers with call centres that handle claims within their scope of activity, where data transmission is governed by cross-border flow agreements.
													Hotel Indonesia Group also processes personal data, based on its legitimate interest, to detect and manage anomalies, notably fraud, which may occur when a Member joins the Programme or when earning or using Points. The data collected in this context is for authorised staff at Hotel Indonesia Group, its services providers and, if necessary, loyalty programme Partners and the manager of the hotel concerned by the anomaly. Members are informed by post of any anomalies related to them.</li>
											</ul>
